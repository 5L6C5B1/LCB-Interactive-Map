As the "Creating a Pokémon inspired RPG in Python & Pygame" tutorial by ClearCode

    some of his codes were added as well as slightly edited.

    Some drawings such as the chairs, tables, etc. were retrieved and/or edited from LimeZu's Modern Interiors tilesets
    along with reference from scarloxy's tilesets from "MonsterTaming Game Essentials - MyPixelWorld Special Packs #01".
